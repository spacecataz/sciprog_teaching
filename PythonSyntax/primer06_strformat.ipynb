    "String Formatting: The Gory Details\n",
    "===================\n",
    "Creating well-formatted strings is one of the most useful skills in any language.  It is necessary for creating readable ASCII files, clean plot titles, and text that reflects the result of a dynamic calculation.\n",
    "Let's explore the syntax for doing this in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting comes via a process known as **string interpolation**.  String interpolation is when the python interpreter takes a string value as typed and replaces certain characters with characters not easily typed- newlines, the values from variables, or special symbols.  To indicate where in a string interpolation should occur, we'll use two tools: **escape characters** and **replacement fields**.  There are different types of strings and string methods that allow us to control when, where, and how interpolation happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the concepts explored here in Python exist in other programming languages.  The functions, syntax, and end result can, of course, vary with each language.\n",

    "Escape Characters\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "Let's start with **escape characters** (also known as **escape sequences**), which give us a way to type the untypeable.  To wit,"

In this case, an escaped \"t\" (`\\t`) equates to a tab character.  Let's look at some more:"
