    "*Procedural programming*, or a programming approach that is centered around calling *procedures* (such as functions or subroutines) is a very common programming paradigm in scientific work.  However, it is many times advantageous to switch to *Object Oriented* programming.  This is where data structures, called *objects*, have internal variables and procedures, called *attributes* and *methods*.  The difference here is that external procedures need to be given the data structures on which to act (as *arguments*), in object oriented programming (OOP), object methods use the information stored within the object to act on something (typically, the object itself).  Let's use Numpy to illustrate the difference between the two.  Let's start by creating some simple arrays of numbers."
